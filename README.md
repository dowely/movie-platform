# movie-platform

Full-stack web application for exploring the cinema world.

## MVP 1:

The application features an empty home page with a single login button that directs users to the /login page. Designed as a Single Page Application (SPA), it allows users to log in as an admin. Upon successful login, users are redirected back to the home page, where they see a simple welcome message from the server, indicating they are logged in. The login button then changes state to display "Log Out". If clicked, users are redirected to the home page again, but this time, no welcome message is shown.
